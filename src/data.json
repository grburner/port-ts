The challenge was creating custom home, product, and landing pages to elegantly display both product lines while providing a great UX. We achieved this by toggling content on the homepage, dependant on a user selection and using metafields to determine what content the product pages are populated with.",

The template empowers the client to change everything from font, just about every color on the page, still images or video, toggling sections, and more. I also was able to work on the Klaviyo integration as well as components on other pages around the site.",
